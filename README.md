### Bikeshare Directory

#### BikeShare Application

This directory contains the BikeShare Terminal Application, which is part of the final project for the "Intro to Programming" course by Udacity.

#### Description

The BikeShare Terminal Application is a command-line program that allows users to explore bike-sharing data for three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Users can select a city and apply filters such as month and day of the week to view statistics related to bike rides, including time statistics, station statistics, trip duration statistics, and user statistics.

#### How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Navigate to the "bikeshare" directory.

3. Run the `bikeshare.py` script using Python, `./bikeshare.py`. (Make sure to enable executable permissions with chmod +x)

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a city and apply filters for analysis.

5. View the statistics displayed in the terminal.

### Visuals Directory

#### BikeShare Visuals Streamlit App

This directory contains the BikeShare Visuals Streamlit App, which is an enhanced version of the final project for the "Intro to Programming" course by Udacity.

#### Description

The BikeShare Visuals Streamlit App is a web application built with Streamlit that provides an interactive user interface for exploring bike-sharing data. Users can select a city and apply filters such as month and day of the week to view statistics related to bike rides, including time statistics, station statistics, trip duration statistics, and user statistics. This version of the project offers a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience compared to the terminal application.

#### How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python and Streamlit installed on your computer.

2. Navigate to the "visuals" directory.

3. Run the Streamlit app using the command `python3 -m streamlit run app.py`, where `app.py` is the name of the Streamlit script.

4. Open a web browser and access the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

5. Use the web interface to select a city and apply filters for analysis.

6. View the statistics displayed in the web app.

#### Note

Both versions of the project offer similar functionality for exploring bike-sharing data but differ in the user interface. You can choose the version that best suits your preferences and needs for analyzing the data.
